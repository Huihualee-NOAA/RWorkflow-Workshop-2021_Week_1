# Week_1 Set-up

To follow along with the material on your own computer, it is best if you can install the following on your computer:

* Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

However, if that is an impediment, you can follow along with RStudio Cloud (with a browser) instead of installing programs. 

* Sign up for an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account
* Once you have an account, [Go to Week 1](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2574104)
* This will open a temporary copy of the material for Week 1.
